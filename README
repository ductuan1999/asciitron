Welcome to asciitron!

This game is related to the movie Tron from 1982.

It supports multiplayer gaming over network (single player is working as well);
start the server like this:

    python asciitron.py serve X

where X defines how many people will play the game. The server will wait
until all players are connected.

The client is started like this:

    python asciitron.py connect localhost X

where X defines your unique player ID. The ID must be a digit between 1 and 9.

To control your snake use the control keys, the VIM keys HJKL or the traditional
WASD. To speed up use "n" (see Nitro tank on the bottom for your playboard). Nitro
can be used whenever it's refilled to 25% again.

Whenever you're running along the outer border, you automatically speed up.

Have fun!
