Welcome to asciitron!

This game is related to the movie Tron from 1982.

It supports multiplayer gaming over network (single player is working as well);

with X defines how many people will play the game. The server will wait
until all players are connected.

The client is started like this:

    python asciitron.py connect localhost X

To control your snake use the control keys, the VIM keys HJKL or the traditional
